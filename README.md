## How to Find a File

There are different folders organised according to their difficulty. (According to CodeChef's website)
The file is named after the problem on CodeChef.

The solution to https://www.codechef.com/problems/MUFFINS3, would be in a file named muffins3.c or muffins3.java or muffins3.py

I've tried to document and comment everything possible.

## Disclaimer

I haven't solved everything by myself. I've

* Read the discussion boards.
* Read other repositories.
* Googled concepts.
* Taken ideas from Blog posts.


## Guide for beginners like me :) 

1. Try solving the problem on your own. Start with the Easy or Beginner section.

2. If you are pretty sure that your solution should work but isn't head over to the comments section for that problem. You might find some trivial mistakes or something special that the judge expects.
Many CodeChef problems are expalined in their blogs. Do read them if you have any difficulty in solving problems.

3. Fix your solution. If you still can't, have a look at other people's submissions. Don't copy and paste it. Read it, understand it and try to reproduce it by yourself.

4. Alterantively you can also have a look in this repo. The file is named after the problem on CodeChef.

5. Press Ctrl + F or search with the problem name. If I've solved it, you'll find it here.
